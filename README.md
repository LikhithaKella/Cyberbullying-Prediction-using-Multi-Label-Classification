# Cyberbullying-Prediction-using-Multi-Label-Classification
## Project Overview
This project focuses on developing a robust system for detecting and classifying cyberbullying in online text data. By leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning models, the goal is to identify various forms of cyberbullying across multiple categories. The approach combines traditional NLP methods with advanced machine learning algorithms to provide an effective solution.

## Key Features
### Data Exploration & Visualization: 
Insightful analysis of the datasets, including label distributions and visualizations, to understand the underlying patterns in the data.
### Text Preprocessing: 
Application of advanced NLP techniques such as tokenization, lemmatization, and feature extraction using methods like TF-IDF and Word2Vec to prepare the data for modeling.
### Model Building: 
Training and fine-tuning of machine learning classifiers, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and ensemble models, along with transformer-based models like RoBERTa for enhanced performance.
### Evaluation: 
Comprehensive evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess the models' effectiveness in detecting and classifying cyberbullying.
### Results Visualization: 
Detailed visual comparison of model performances, showcasing strengths, weaknesses, and areas for improvement.

## Objective
